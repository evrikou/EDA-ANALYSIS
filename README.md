# EDA-ANALYSIS : Netflix 
This notebook demonstrates a simple data analysis of Netflix Movies & TV-Shows using python. The dataset provides information about their release year, the age certification, the ratings etc.

⚠ Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and in any case the results are not guaranteed to be best practice. 
Also some movies or shows may vary from country to country as or by the time the dataset was taken since netflix's content is not the same for each country and keeps updated too often.
