# EDA-ANALYSIS : Netflix 
This notebook demonstrates a simple data analysis of Netflix Movies & TV-Shows using python. The dataset provides information about their release year, the age certification, the ratings etc.

⚠ Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and in any case the results are not guaranteed to be best practice. 
Also some movies or shows may vary from country to country as or by the time the dataset was taken since netflix's content is not the same for each country and keeps updated too often.

# Dataset
The Dataset was downloaded from:

https://www.kaggle.com/

More specifically I have worked with the following csv dataset

imdb_movies_shows.csv

# Contents
a) Exploration of the dataset to see if we need to clean our info
b) Min-max normalization in order to bring all values of imdb_score into a consistent range so that they can be combined with imdb_votes and compared more easily

a) Which are the top rated movies and tv-shows
b) In which year were released most of the top rated and tv-shows
c) Which are the most common genres that people prefer (based on the top rated and tv-shows)
d) What is the average duration for movies and shows
